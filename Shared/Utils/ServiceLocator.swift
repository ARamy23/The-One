/// Basic Dependency Container pattern called ServiceLocator, a basic Singleton which allows easy access to dependency of the system or services
///
/// Decision Log behind
///
/// ServiceLocator acts as a simple dependency container without any fanciness until we face a heavy usage for threading, in this
/// case, we can explore our options from either using a dedicated dependency container pattern, or we can apply locks
/// for now, we are using
///  ```
///  safeSync { (Async Code goes here) }
///  ```
/// Behind the scenes, this checks if the current thread is main, if not, it switches to it and executes the async code
